# Soveltuva_Projekti_TKO_8971_Ilo_Rami

Course work for the course "TKO 8971 Applied Project, Department of Future Technologies ". 
An image-recognition machine learning projectmade for CIFAR-100 -dataset, but easily usable on other datasets. Using Keras, Tensorflow and Numpy libraries.
Has some utilities, such as previewing in Jupyter Notebook and model saving/loading.
Run main.py to execute the program, or open Cifar100_preview_example.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to preview predictions.
If you are either retraining or previewning, make sure to have the files "cifar100_model.h5" and "cifar100_model.json" in the execution folder.
